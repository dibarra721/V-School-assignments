        I have no plumbing experience, so we will be working as a collective.
        <br/>My Astrology 
        I'm a Cancer, so you better believe I will cry, and ask for a hug.<br/>
        I'm a Scorpio Moon so you also better believe I will be suscipucus about everything.<br/>
        I'm an Aries rising, so I'm stubborn as hell, so don't give me advice unless I ask.
