<ol>

There are a lot of reasons why people choose to practice Kundalini—like its effect on both your physical and psychological well-being. Below are some of the most popular health benefits of Kundalini, including a faster metabolism, better mood, and lowered stress levels.
<li> Builds strength</li>
Because you hold each posture for an extended period of time (sometimes up to five minutes!), Kundalini yoga is a great way to strengthen and tone your muscles. Some of the more intense breathing techniques—like Breath of Fire—can also build core strength, as you have to engage your abdominal muscles with each exhale.
<li> Improves your mood</li>
That “high” you get after a sweaty yoga class is a real thing—research has found that regularly practicing Kundalini yoga increases the production of serotonin (the happy hormone) in your brain.
<li> Lowers your blood pressure and heart rate</li>
Studies have repeatedly shown that Kundalini yoga—specifically the deep breathing techniques used during it—can decrease the risk of hypertension. Long, slow breaths calm your autonomic nervous system and reduce stress, thus lowering both your blood pressure and pulse rate.
<li> Enhances your memory and focus
According to research, Kundalini yoga can impact cognitive functioning, boosting both your concentration and memory. 
Even the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundation recommends a Kundalini kriya for improving memory retention. </li>
<li> Boosts your metabolism and digestive system
Through the combination of breath and postures, Kundalini yoga is focused on strengthening your core and diaphragm. 
This in turn improves your digestion and has been shown by researchers to speed up metabolism (meaning your body processes energy more efficiently).</li>
